#Problem Statement:
Many students studying in Malayalam medium schools struggle to understand large amounts of study material. They often need help finding answers from Malayalam PDF notes. There are very few tools that support learning in regional languages like Malayalam using AI.

* To assist Malayalam medium students in learning by enabling better access to educational content in their native language.

* To explore the use of AI in understanding and responding to questions from Malayalam-language documents.

* To promote inclusive and regional language learning through technology-based solutions.

* To build a tool that simplifies self-study by allowing students to ask questions from their uploaded Malayalam notes.
